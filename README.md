## Requirements
For development, you will only need Node.js and a node global package installed in your environement and mongodb for database.

### Node
* Node Installtion on Windows
  Go on to the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/) and download the installer. Also, be sure to have `.git`  available in your PATH,
  `npm` might need it (You can find [git](https://git-scm.com/)).
  
 * Other operating System
   You can find more information about the installation on the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/) and the official [NPM website](https://www.npmjs.com/).
  
  If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.
  ```
  $ node --version
  v16.13.0

  $ npm --version
  8.2.0
 ```
 
 If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`! Cool right? After running the following command, just open again the command line and be happy.
 ```
 $ npm install npm -g
 
 ```
